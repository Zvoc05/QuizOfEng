# Quiz for learning English
Quiz of English language.<br><br>Simple website I did for my High School project.<br>Some of the variables and folders may be in Croatian language so you know.
<p>I did this project this year in June and now that i started College, I have more interest in git and all this stuf about programing so i thoguh it will be a good idea i share something with other people in need. I know its not really that much but i hope it helps</p><br>
<p>Firstly, you should build database. I lost my exported file of database but if i find it i will upload it. Even without it you could probably figure it out by looking in php files. Btw it's not all my code. Some of it i found on internet so i dont want to claim credits for everything (my work is like 85% of this project)</p>
<br>
<p>So the first page you want to open is welcome.php (after you make database and keep apache turned on). There you can make account with your credentials (btw password is automaticaly encripted in database). After register or login you can play with site. I know its not much but can be template for small project.</p>
<br>
<p>Feel free to use this as much as you want and do anything with it. Also, if i have some grammar errors don't be so critical because English is not my main language</p>
